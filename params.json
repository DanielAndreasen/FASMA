 "body":"### Welcome to MOOGme\r\nMOOGme is a python package to make a simple interface around LTE software [MOOG](http://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html). The acronym stands for `MOOG made easy`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nWith this software, stellar atmospheric parameters can be derived based on the EW method.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Planned features\r\nWe plan to add features in the future. This include:\r\n\r\n   - A GUI to control the process\r\n   - Multiple atmospheric models (currently only 1 grid is supported)\r\n   - Package like a real python package (pypi)\r\n   - Synthesis of spectral regions (not decided yet)\r\n   - Implementing [ARES](http://www.astro.up.pt/~sousasag/ares/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe authors of this package are @MariaTsantaki, @gdcteixeira, and @DanielAndreasen.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the package? Feel free to report a bug/issue at the [issue pages](https://github.com/DanielAndreasen/MOOGme/issues) or create a [pull request](https://github.com/DanielAndreasen/MOOGme/pulls) and weâ€™ll try our best to help you.",
