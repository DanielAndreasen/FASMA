Dear MOOG users:

The first major overhaul of MOOG in several years has occurred.  Andy
McWilliam has worked especially on corrected and expanded "Barklem"
damping data and algorithms.  Several folks, especially Christian Johnson,
Andy McWilliam, Caty Pilachowski, Marc Schaeuble, and Jennifer Sobeck,
have contributed a lot of testing time to verify the coding.  I appreciate
all your comments that were received, even if I don't cite you by
name.

Below I list the major changes to the code.  As always, final
responsibility for MOOG rests with me, and I will be very grateful
to anyone who can identify bugs (they undoubtedly exist) in the
new code.  Please compare the new outputs to those you are familiar
with in old code versions, and make sure that they are the same
or similar (see below).

Yes, the MOOG writeup needs to be updated.  I'll get to it "soon".

      Regards, Chris Sneden


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the most significant changes to MOOG:

--- Solar abundance defaults are those of Asplund et al. 2009, ARA&A.

--- A more sensible default molecule list for equilibrium computations
    has been put in place.  If the user does not specify any value
    of the (new) parameter "molset", or says "molset 0", a set molecules
    involving only H, C, N, O, Mg, and Ti will be employed.  If the
    user instead explicitly says "molset 1" then a much larger set
    of molecules (more suited to M-star calculations) will be employed
   in molecular equilibrium.  All this is detailed in comment
   statements in Bmolec.f .

--- At Andy's suggestion, I put a damper in Linabund.f so that when an
    synthesized EW is needing another iteration to match the observed
    EW, AND the log(RW) > -4.7, then the abundance change is slowed
    down (this seems to get predicted and observed EWs to agree more
    easily for strong lines).

--- Andy's corrections to Barklem damping and his additions of radiative
    damping for all Barklem lines have been implemented.

--- A fix has been made to the stupidity that Caty and collaborators
    found for molecular lines in abfind.

--- Corrections have been made to the explicit damping routine "trudamp"
    (meaning that now it works!) and shift of Andy's Ca II K-line
    explicit damping from "damping" to "trudamp".

--- If the input damping number from the user is > 1e-4 then that is
    the value the user wants; this is a change from > 1e-5.  99.9%
    of users will not encounter this situation.

--- I added arbitrary explicitly huge radiatiive damping constants
    for CH 3693A, and Ca I 6318, 6343, 6361A autoionization lines; the
    constants are set empirically to match the breadth of the lines;  the
    user can modify this by multiplying the assumed damping by the
    damping number that is the 5th parameter in that line's input
    to the linelist (wavelength, ID, chi, loggf, dampnum).

--- A trap has been set to catch users who are attempting to make
    synthetic spectrum wavelength step sizes more precise than 0.001A.

--- Abundance outputs (particularly those relevant to EW analyses) now
    will have numbers with 3 significant digits instead of 2.  Moreover,
    a new column in the abfind and ewfind summary output files gives
    the numeric species value of each line.  The naive user will
    undoubtedly believe in the "accuracy" of these 3-digit abundances,
    but my attitude is "not my problem".

--- Various and sundry internal plumbing changes have been done to make
    routines more clear and hopefully less fragile.  Only a true fan
    of coding would be interested in these, and I can't remember a
    lot of them.
